### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer specializing in JavaScript, am proficient in TypeScript and Go, and am an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.

From training and managing employees, teaching math to at-risk students, and fostering children, I love solving problems with and for people.
I co-created Mayfly, an open-source tool for deploying dedicated user sessions to the browser.
