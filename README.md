### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack software engineer specializing in JavaScript and proficient in TypeScript, Go, and AWS. I co-created Mayfly, an open-source tool for deploying user session backends. I enjoyed teaching secondary math to at-risk students, training and managing employees, and fostering children with my wife.
